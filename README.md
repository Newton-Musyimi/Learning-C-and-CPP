# Learning-C-and-CPP
 I am teaching myself C and C++ because I need C for hardware programming and C++ for software development.
 I am using the GNU C++ Compiler version 8.2.0
## Compiling and Running
To compile the file, g++ <filename.cpp>
This compiles to a a.exe file
To run the file, ./a.exe
To compile with a custom executable file name, g++ -o <customname.exe> <filename.cpp>

## Parts of a C++ Program
The # is a signal to the preprocessor. The preprocessor is run every time the compiler is started. It looks for all lines starting with the # symbol and acts on them before the compiler runs. This gets the code file ready for the compiler.

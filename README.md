# Learning-C-and-CPP
 I am teaching myself C and C++ because I need C for hardware programming and C++ for software development
## Compiling and Running
To compile the file, g++ <filename.cpp>
This compiles to a a.exe file
To run the file, ./a.exe
To compile with a custom executable file name, g++ -o <customname.exe> <filename.cpp>
